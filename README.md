# Compilation and Installation
## Build without tests:
```make``` or ```make all```
In the root directory of the project. 
The binaries will be built into ./bin. 
The binaries are:
```libsoboutils.a```

## Build with tests:
```make alltest```
In the same directory will do the same + build tests. 
The binaries will be built into ./bin.
The binaries are:
```libsoboutils.a```
```test_utils_file```
```test_utils_string```
```test_utils_time```

## Install in the common paths:
After ```make```, ```make all```  or ```make alltest``` has been done, call:
```make install```
in the root directory of the project.
**WARNING: requires the sudo access**.

The library (libsoboutils.a) and the header file will be put in the target 
common directories, defined into the makefile in the variables:
SOBOUTILS_INCLUDE_PATH ?= '/usr/local/share/soboutils'
SOBOUTILS_LIB_PATH     ?= '/usr/local/lib/soboutils'

You may change those paths to conform with your system configuration.
